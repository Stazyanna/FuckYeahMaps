#Witch Hunts and Trials
<p> So because I like maps and procrastinating I made this interactive web map of historic European witch hunts (although I threw Salem in for good measure). I also did this because I want to show everyone how awesome open sources software is and that you donâ€™t need a degree to do and display some basic research.

Also because I read Caliban and the Witch (pdf if you follow that link) last year and I wanted to find ways of visibilising aspects of womens history. Creating the database for this map was like falling down a rabbit hole; I just kept on discivering more and more tragedy, and the numbers of executions and trials just kept stacking up and up. Just to be clear, the cases presented here are mainly only those in which more than one woman was tried and that the trial was recorded, there must be many cases which went as unrecorded lynchings, or which only involved a single trial. If you know of any other cases of witch trials or witch hunts, please let me know. </p>
